# Digital Logic Circuit Simulator in Rust

This repository is a Rust port of the original C++ [Digital Logic Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/InfinitePain/Digital-Logic-Circuit-Simulator). The project simulates digital logic circuits, including basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR), half adders, and full adders.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning exercise in Rust programming while replicating the functionality of the original C++ version.

## Features

- Simulation of basic logic gates: AND, OR, XOR
- Implementation of half adders and full adders
- Modular and extensible code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InfinitePain/Rust-Basics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Rust-Basics/digital-logic-circuit-simulator-rust
   ```

### Running the Program

To run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Acknowledgments

This Rust port acknowledges the original C++ implementation developed as an assignment for the "Programmieren 2" course at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences. Special thanks to the instructors and contributors of the original project.
